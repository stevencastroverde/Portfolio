            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>I have sort of a strange way finding my way into Web Development/Software Engineering....</p>

            <p>My name is Steven Castroverde, and I was born and raised in Denver, Colorado. I attended the University of Colorado Boulder and earned my degree in International Relations & Mandarin Chinese. Yes I do speak Chinese and during my undergrad I even lived in China. I love travelling, hiking, skiing, cooking, playing video games, and many more things, but most of all I love coding.</p>

            <p>When I got out of college I started working at the Denver County Court as a Judicial Assistant. In this role I was responsible for helping maintain case files, helping judges, and most of all helping the general public. When I was helping people, I started to think of ways technology could help solve their problems, and I saw first hand how technology that never thinks about the user can render software useless. I ended up beginning to teach myself Web Development, and my first project was a HTML email of all things. I became hooked, and I wanted to build larger and more complex apps.</p>

            <p> I attended Galvanize Full-Stack Web Immersive Program, and havenâ€™t looked back since. I am now a Full-Stack Web Developer, looking for my next adventure! I want to join a team where I can continue to grow as a developer, and make awesome software. Take a look at my resume, and feel free to contact me.</p>
